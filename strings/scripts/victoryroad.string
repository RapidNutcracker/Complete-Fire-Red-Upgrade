Oi, wait up!

#org @gText_VRBrendanBattle_2
Hey, it's me again[.]\pSorry I couldn't help you further\nin [GREEN]Cerulean Cave[BLUE].\pI got destroyed by [GREEN]Archer[BLUE] and ran\naway in shame[.]

#org @gText_VRBrendanBattle_3 
You know recently[.]\pI don't know, I know I'm not a\nbad trainer by any means.\pI can snag Gym badges sure, \nbut I've always wanted to be an\lincredible trainer like my Dad.\pAnd I really thought that as long\nas I put in the effort and work,\lI could be one of the best.\pBut, I could never put a dent\nin you.\pEven trainers like [GREEN]Archer[BLUE] have\nshown me how far the gap between\lus has become.\pIt's becoming clear to me that I'm\njust not very strong,\llet alone talented.

#org @gText_VRBrendanBattle_4
Is that what I'm missing?\pAn innate trait that some are just\ngifted with?\pI just can't accept that[.]\p

#org @gText_VRBrendanBattle_5
Agh! I'm not sure what\nI'm trying to say.

#org @gText_VRBrendanBattle_6
I don't care.\n[GREEN][PLAYER][BLUE]!\pWe're battling.\pI won't take no for an answer!

#org @gText_VRBrendanLoss
Not sure what I was\nexpecting[.]

#org @gText_VRBrendanBattle_7
I[.] I don't know.\pI'm discouraged. I know I shouldn't\nhave shot for the stars, but[.]

#org @gText_VRBrendanBattle_8
The bottom line is I have a lot\nto learn.\pI'll be returning to Hoenn to train\nwith my Dad.\pMaybe I'll come back sometime.\pOr you could come visit,\nif you'd like.\pI know, somehow, our paths will\ncross again.\pI still must thank you for always\npushing me to my limit.\pIn case I never see you again,\ntake this.

#org @gText_VRBrendanBattle_9
It's really useful for breeding,\nbut I'm sure you already knew\lthat.\pI don't need to stick around to\nsee you win it all,\lyou already ooze Champion status.\pDon't disappoint me!

#org @gText_VRBrendanBattle_10
So long, friend.

#org @gText_dada_MartGreetingMsg 
Welcome!\pHow may I help you?

#org @gText_dada_MartLeavingMsg
Please come again!

#org @gText_FinalCreatorBattle_1
Well well, thought you could\nwaltz into the Pok\emon League\lwithout another boss battle?\p[.]Who the hell am I?\pI'm [GREEN]soupercell[BLUE], the creator of\nthis hack, dumbass!\pAnyway, I can't let any scrubs\ncomplete my game, so I'll need\lto give you an ass-whooping.

#org @gText_FinalCreatorBattle_Loss
W-what?! You[.]\nYou beat my invincible strat?!

#org @gText_FinalCreatorBattle_2
Hot damn!\pI don't know why I doubted you!\pYou're certainly ready.\pI've reserved this item for you,\nit's among one of the most\lbonkers Mega Evos so, you know,\lsave the best for last. 

#org @gText_FinalCreatorBattle_3
Anyway, thanks for playing my ROM\nhack [GREEN][PLAYER][BLUE], even if you didn't\lenjoy it.\pFeel free to leave feedback!\pOf course, stay safe if you're\nstill stuck in quarantine.\pHave a good one, friend!
