#org @gText_ceruleancavelevelscript_1
[BLUE]Hm, nothing suspicious so far[.]

#org @gText_ceruleancavelevelscript_2
[RED]Well well, if it isn't the two scrubs\nback in Silph Co.

#org @gText_ceruleancavelevelscript_3
[BLUE]Agh! Team Rocket!\pI knew it!\pWhat do you think you're doing?!

#org @gText_ceruleancavelevelscript_4
[RED]Ariana: It doesn't concern you.\pI'll have you taken care of.

#org @gText_ceruleancavelevelscript_5
[GREEN][PLAYER][BLUE], go on\nahead!\pI'll catch up with you later!

#org @gText_ceruleancavelevelscript_6
[RED]Tsk, whatever.\pYou won't be able to stop the boss\nanyway.

#org @gText_arianaceruelancave_1
[GREEN]Mawile, [RED]use Play Rough!

#org @gText_arianaceruelancave_2
What the hell are you looking at?\pI'll take care of you after.

#org @gText_brendanceruleancave_1
[GREEN]Sceptile, [BLUE]use Focus Blast!

#org @gText_brendanceruleancave_2
[GREEN][PLAYER][BLUE], go on\nahead!\pI'll catch up with you later!

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt4_EncounterText
The boss's plan?\pMy guess is as good as yours.

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt4_DefeatText
Being a good trainer[.]\nCouldn't be me.

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt4_AfterBattle
The boss's plan?\pMy guess is as good as yours.

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt3_EncounterText
Aw, jeez.\pI remember you[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt3_DefeatText
Must be nice being strong.

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt3_AfterBattle
Must be nice being the protag-\nonist.

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt2_EncounterText
I'm just following orders.

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt2_DefeatText
Well, no surprise there.

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt2_AfterBattle
I'm just here as I was promised\nsome speedb. 

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt1_EncounterText
Hey, you ought to turn back.

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt1_DefeatText
Crushed by a kid,\nas usual.

#org @gText_ceruleangrunt1_AfterBattle
Most Team Rocket members left\nafter the latest ordeal.\pI have no idea why I'm still\nhere to be honest.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_1
[BLUE]Hey, looks like we caught up.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_2
[RED]There's no escape.\pYour friend isn't here to stop us\nthis time.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_3
[BLUE]Don't worry, he's safe.\pHe's gone to the Pok\emon center after\nour skirmish.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_4
[RED]You know[.]

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_5
[RED]We're gonna cut the crap.\pWe honestly don't know what the boss\nis up to ourselves.\pAfter his last defeat against you[.]\p

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_6
[BLUE]He's definitely become unhinged.\pAnyway[.]

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_7
[BLUE]He's never been one to tell us\nmuch, so we're basically in the dark\labout what this mission is[.]

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_8
[RED]But[.] orders are orders.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_10
[BLUE]We're loyal to the boss,\nperhaps to a fault.\pYou aren't getting to him.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_11
[RED]Well[.] here goes.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_12
[BLUE]You might be the strongest trainer\nI've ever faced.\pPerhaps you may be able to\ntalk some sense into our boss[.]\pIt'd be nice if he could have some\nfaith in us, but he won't listen to\lme.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_13
[RED]Not me, either.\pBut, we're still concerned for him.\pWe're really sorry for the trouble.\pAnd please, have this.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_14
[BLUE]I would apologize too,\nbut I know we were always just\lpushovers for you[.]\p[.]Hah! You're smiling.\pI knew it.\pFrom me, then.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_15
[BLUE]If he's doing what I think\nhe's doing, you may be in trouble[.]\pBut, we have faith in you.\pPlease, stop our boss[.]

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_16
[RED]Good luck.

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_Archerloss
That's how it be[.]

#org @gText_ceruleanarcherariana_Arianaloss
Heh[.]\nI'm actually impressed.

#org @gText_healstoptheboss_1
Please[.] stop the boss.

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_1
[BLUE]I see you've come to stop me\nyet again[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_2
[BLUE]Unfortunately, you won't be the hero\nthis time.\pYou're too late.

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_3
[GREEN]Mewtwo![BLUE] You're mine!

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_4
[BLACK]Mew!

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_5
[BLUE]Master Ball, go!

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_6
[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_Defeated
W-what?!\nImpossible[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_7
[BLUE]Aha! The Master Ball my scientists\nmade works!\pAnd attaching this Mega Stone that\nwe've worked hard on[.]\pI'm practically invincible!

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_8
[BLUE]You still dare to stop me\nknowing I have [GREEN]Mega Mewtwo[BLUE]?\pWell, the honor is mine, you insolent\nchild!

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_8_2 
[GREEN]???[BLUE]: Woah, things are getting out\nof hand here[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_8_3 
[GREEN]Lance[BLUE]: Hi there, just the champion\nstopping by to help put an end\lto this mess. 

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_8_4 
[GREEN]Giovanni[BLUE]: Hm, no matter.\nI can't possibly be stopped with\lMega Mewtwo. 

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_8_5 
[GREEN]Lance[BLUE]: Sorry, [PLAYER], was it?\nI came here rather short of notice,\lso I don't have my best Pok\emon on me.\pYou'll have to help me out here.

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_8_6 
[GREEN]Giovanni[BLUE]: Have at me then, you fools! 

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_9
[BLUE]Even with [GREEN]Mega Mewtwo[BLUE],\nI've fallen by your hands.\pI[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_Awaydialogue
[BLUE]I am truly humbled.\pMy plan for world domination is\nbut a dream.

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_10
[BLUE]I threw aside family for this[.]\pAbandoned my wife,\neven my own son[.]\pDespite my defeat at Silph Co,\nI couldn't give up on my plan.

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_11
[BLUE]I admit, I was a victim of the\nsunk-cost fallacy[.]\pBut, I've given up literally every-\nthing for this[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_12
[GREEN]Archer and Ariana[BLUE]: Boss!

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_13
[GREEN]Giovanni[BLUE]: Wha[.]\nArcher, Ariana?

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_14
[GREEN]Archer[BLUE]: Not everything, sir.

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_15
[RED]You still have us!\pPlease, sir, have faith in us[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_16
[GREEN]Archer[BLUE]: We've stuck with you\nthrough thick and thin boss, you\lcould learn to rely on us,\leven if just a little[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_17
[RED]Could you have any doubt\non our loyalty?\pEver since you took us in\nwhen we were lowly children, with\lno home to go to[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_18
[BLUE]You're truly family to us!\pMore than just our boss!

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_19
[RED]Although we don't agree with\neverything you do, we will stand by\lyou no matter what.

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_20
[GREEN]Giovanni[BLUE]: You two[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_21
[BLUE]I'm sorry[.]\pMy crude ambitions have blinded\nme[.]

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_22
[BLUE]You guys are more than family.\pWe sh-

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_23
[BLUE]Wha?!\pMewtwo escaped out of my Master\nBall!

#org @gText_ceruleangiovanni_24
[BLACK]Mewtwo: [PLAYER][.]\pWhen you are worthy,\nplease return to me.

#org @gText_e4check_1
[BLACK]Mewtwo: No [PLAYER][.]\pYou are not worthy yet.

#org @gText_MewtwoBattle
I see you've returned,\neven more capable.\pFine, let me unleash my full\npotential to see if you're truly\lworthy!
