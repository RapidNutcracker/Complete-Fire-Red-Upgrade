# Complete Fire Red Upgrade - Pokemon Radical Red

## What is this:
This is my fork of CFRU, short for Complete FireRed Upgrade, which is an engine upgrade
that updates the battle mechanics of Pokémon Fire Red while also adding a ton of other
neat features. I've tailored and modified it significantly for my ROM hack. A full
release and more information of this ROM hack can be found [here](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=437688).

All scripts written for new events can be found in assembly/overworld_scripts.

Pretty much all files in src/ have been modified to some degree. Have also
made some changes in assembly code in general_attack_battle_scripts.s for
unique behaviors of some new attacks.
